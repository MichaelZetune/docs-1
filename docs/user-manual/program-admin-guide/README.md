## Features for Program Admin

### Export and disaggregate data&#x20;

With CiviForm, Program Admins can review applications directly in the tool. They can also export data into a CSV file if preferred. CiviForm features allow for disaggregation of data to identify trends within applications and resident needs. Our team is currently working on several features for Program Admins to filter, make non-applicant facing notes, and integrate CiviForm into existing systems using an API.

![View applications by program directly in CiviForm. Search through applications by program and open specific applications to review data. Status tracking is a new feature currently being built.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Viewing all applications with option to download csv (1).png>)
