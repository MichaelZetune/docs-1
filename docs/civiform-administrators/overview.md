  CiviForm Admin are the government employees who create and update
  applications. These users manage CiviForm for their civic entity and can
  maintain the tool without ever needing to go into the code.

# Overview

### Create, update, and publish program applications in one place&#x20;

CiviForm Admins can use the platform’s unified application builder to create and publish applications for public benefits programs. For each program created, these users can create and define the requirements for an application. They can also use ‘question types’ to validate that information is entered correctly.

For example, if a CiviForm Admin wants addresses to be inputted in a consistent format, they can select the ‘address question type’ that CiviForm will validate for accuracy. The meaning of that address field however will be determined by the CiviForm Admin (e.g. is it the applicant’s address? an employer address? a spouse?).

When an application needs to be updated, a new version will be created with all past versions stored in the tool for future reference.&#x20;

### Reuse questions from a shared question bank&#x20;

When a CiviForm Admin creates a new question for an application, it is saved in a global, shared question bank. This shared repository removes the need to recreate questions for applications such as date of birth or social security number.

### Show or hide relevant information to applicants&#x20;

Many times, a form will need to ask or show people different information based on their answers. For example, an applicant with dependents below the age of 12 should see questions related to school benefits. Alternatively, an applicant below the age of 65 should not be shown benefits for seniors. CiviForm supports these scenarios through visibility conditions. When a CiviForm Admin creates conditions to show or hide information based on previous answers, applicants will see questions that are most relevant to their situation. For example, CiviForm can determine if additional information is needed or if the applicant can skip part of the application. Our team is also working on features that will show related benefits programs for which an applicant may be eligible.
