# CiviForm Docs

CiviForm is an open-source platform that streamlines the way residents find and sign up for public assistance. This self-service tool also enables public servants to manage forms for public benefits programs without ever needing to go into the backend code.

In the Civiform docs, you can find:

* [Overview of Civiform](overview/what-is-civiform.md) for a high-level summary and how Civiform works
* [User Manuals](broken-reference/) for how to set up and use Civiform in your organization or program
* [IT Manuals](broken-reference/) for how to deploy CiviForm on your technical infrastructure
* [Contributor Guides](broken-reference/) for how to contribute product improvements
* [Governance & Management Documentation](broken-reference/) for information on how CiviForm is being collaboratively managed and developed
