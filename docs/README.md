# CiviForm Docs

CiviForm is an open-source platform that streamlines the way residents find and sign up for public assistance. This self-service tool also enables government employees to manage forms without ever needing to go into the backend code.

In the docs, you will find:

* [Overview of CiviForm](overview/what-is-civiform.md) with a high-level summary on how the platform works
* [User Manuals](user-manual/civiform-admin-guide.md) to set up and use CiviForm in your organization or program
* [IT Manuals](it-manual/sre-playbook.md) to deploy CiviForm on your technical infrastructure
* [Contributor Guides](contributor-guide/developer-guide.md) to contribute product improvements
* [Governance & Management Documentation](governance-and-management/project-management.md) with information on how CiviForm is being collaboratively managed and developed
